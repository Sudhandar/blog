## About Me {: #about-me }

I’m Sudhandar Balakrishnan, an **Applied AI Consultant** who helps growing companies build AI systems that drive real business results.

Before consulting, I worked as a **Data Scientist at Loblaws**, where I built AI systems that processed over 300,000 patient profiles, automated compliance audits across 700,000+ forms, and cut operational risks that could have cost millions in fines.

I also hold a **Master’s degree in Computer Engineering from Queen’s University**, where I specialized in Artificial Intelligence. My research focused on applying **Generative AI techniques to financial data**.

Over the years, I’ve built dozens of AI proof-of-concepts that never made it into production. That frustration pushed me to dig deeper into why. 

I realized that AI research is very different from Applied AI. Applied AI is about building systems that fit your business and deliver measurable results.This realization made me pivot to working on systems that actually drive business results.

That’s the gap I help companies overcome.

### Professional Experience

- **Data Scientist II at Loblaw Companies Limited**
    - Delivered 300,000+ personalized patient profiles that enabled targeted health recommendations, increasing patient engagement and improving long-term care outcomes
   
    - Automated medication review audits using GenAI, expanding coverage from 1,000 to 700,000 forms enabling healthcare providers to identify high-risk patients 86% faster
   
    - Reduced critical data loss detection from 3+ days to just 6 hours eliminating compliance risks that could have resulted in millions in regulatory penalties
   
    - Built NER systems that increased condition identification by 300%, enabling early interventions that improved both patient outcomes and operational efficiency


- **Data Scientist at ZoomRx Inc.**
    - Partnered with pharmaceutical leaders (Pfizer, Genentech, Bristol Myers Squibb) to deliver AI solutions that drove strategic decision-making
    - Implemented a $2M RAG knowledge graph system that transformed how pharma clients accessed critical information saving them 8+ hours weekly in research time
    - Automated ETL pipelines that eliminated 20+ hours of manual work monthly, allowing clients to redirect resources to high-value initiatives
