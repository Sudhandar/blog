I help mid-sized healthcare organizations and digital-health startups accelerate AI deployment by 1–2 months through compliance-ready RAG systems and automation pipelines—reducing operational costs by up to 50%, while eliminating millions in regulatory risks and manual efforts.

With a robust foundation in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing, I have developed innovative solutions—including GenAI-powered models, AI Agents, RAG systems and automated cloud pipelines—that have significantly enhanced healthcare analytics and patient care. My expertise extends beyond technical implementation to strategic initiatives such as pitching to senior leadership, securing new projects, and driving business growth.
