The email with the post information is more personalized and is more likely to get a response. The more context you give to the personalization engine, the better it gets. Now we could achieve the same with likes and the posts they have commented on.</p> <p>Now that we understand the difference it makes in outreach, let's see how this personalization happens in the next section.</p>"},{"location":"blog/personalized-outreach/#personalization-engine","title":"Personalization Engine:","text":"<p>This is the core of our personalized outreach strategy - the personalization engine. Here, the personalization happens on two fronts:</p> <ol> <li>Personalization based on the Lead and their activity on LinkedIn</li> <li>Personalization based on the Outreach Company's Branding and Voice</li> </ol> <p>We talked about how we get information about the leads to personalize the outreach for them. There are three levels of personalization we could achieve based on the Lead's activity on LinkedIn:</p> <ol> <li> <p>High Personalization - For leads who are highly active on LinkedIn by posting, reacting and commenting on posts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Medium Personalization - For leads who are moderately active on LinkedIn. They comment and like on the post of others sporadically, and they occasionally post on their own.</p> </li> <li> <p>Low Personalization - For leads who are not active on LinkedIn. For such cases, our only option would be to use their profile information. </p> </li> </ol> <p>But it's not just about personalizing the outreach for the leads. The personalization and the overall tone of the outreach messages should be in line with the company that's doing the outreach.</p> <p>This is where your company's branding comes into play. Each company will have its own style, its own voice, and its own branding. It's essential we incorporate them into the personalization message. Not just a generic cold outreach email from a template.</p> <p>So for the personalization engine, we first personalize the outreach for the lead based on the lead's activity on LinkedIn. Then we adjust the outreach message using your company's (the company that's doing the outreach) branding and voice.</p> <p>We talked about the fictional company LendFlow for this blog. Let's assume LendFlow's communication style is professional but approachable. LendFlow never uses overly familiar language with strangers, generic industry buzzwords, lengthy explanations, or pushy and aggressive calls-to-action.</p> <p>Now that we have seen the personalization levels, let's see examples of the personalized outreach messages in line with the company's branding and voice.</p> <p>Note: The email template I have used in the following examples could be replaced with the email template you are currently using which aligns with your branding and voice</p> <p>Why use email instead of sending this message via LinkedIn?</p> <ul> <li>To message a lead on LinkedIn, you have to be connected to them. We have to automate the process of connecting to the leads</li> <li>What if the lead doesn't accept the connection request?</li> <li>The thing with cold outreach is that it's a numbers game. With email, we have to send a lot of messages to get a response. With LinkedIn, we have to send a lot of connection requests, hope our request gets accepted, and then hope to get a response</li> <li>Doing this on LinkedIn adds an additional layer of failure like not accepting the connection request</li> </ul> <p>Hence, we use email to reach out to the leads. </p> <p>P.S. We could still use LinkedIn to message if you are okay with the additional layer of failure like not accepting the connection request.</p>"},{"location":"blog/personalized-outreach/#high-personalization","title":"High Personalization:","text":"<pre><code>SUBJECT: Loved the Alzheimer\u2019s golf story\u2014quick question on scaling your underwriting team  \n\nHi &lt;Anonymized&gt;,\n\nYour recent post about the 4th Annual Charity Golf Tournament for the Alzheimer Society really stood out.
